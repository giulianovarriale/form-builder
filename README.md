Inspired by [a post from Yangshun Tay](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7317396289673916418?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_updateV2%3A%28urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7317396289673916418%2CFEED_DETAIL%2CEMPTY%2CDEFAULT%2Cfalse%29), CEO of GreatFrontEnd, I decided to build my own form builder as an exercise.
Through this app, you can easily craft custom forms, share them with your audience, and gain insights from their responses.

**Note:** This is a prototype app. Data may not be consistently saved. We recommend not using it for critical or real-world tasks.

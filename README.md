* [ ] Real Performance: investigate if it is possible to improve response time 
* [ ] Accessibility: make sure keyboard users can use the app
* [ ] Accessibility: make sure screen reader users can use the app
* [ ] Accessiblity: evaluate color contrast
* [ ] Responsiveness: make sure user can use the app on mobile

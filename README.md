Inspired by [a post from Yangshun Tay](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7317396289673916418?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_updateV2%3A%28urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7317396289673916418%2CFEED_DETAIL%2CEMPTY%2CDEFAULT%2Cfalse%29), CEO of GreatFrontEnd, I decided to build my own form builder as an exercise.

**Note: The form builder is still work in progress**

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
